## Abstract
With roughly 500 million tweets sent per day, many of which come from the United States, there is a thought to what the general “mood” of the U.S. Twitter population is. The goal of this project is to train a model to recognize characteristics of a tweet and classify them by the appropriate sentiment. In order to classify these tweets by sentiment we will use a supervised machine learning model; using a data set that has pre-labeled sentiments, a model can be trained to accurately predict which of several sentiments a tweets conveys such as “anger” or “trust” along with a positive or negative sentiment. While the first goal of the project is to predict only whether a given tweet is positive/negative, if possible we would like to also predict the emotion associated with the tweet. Only tweets with location meta-data will be collected such that mapping of the classified tweets within the United States Latitude/Longitude Boundary box is possible; this will allow for a visualization of the “mood” of twitter.
